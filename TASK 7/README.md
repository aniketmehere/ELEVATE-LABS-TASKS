****Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions****

****Objective****
The objective of this task was to inspect, identify, and remove potentially suspicious or unused browser extensions in order to improve browser security and performance.

****Tools Used****
- Google Chrome Browser  
- Chrome Extension Manager (chrome://extensions/)  
- Chrome Web Store for review and rating verification  

****Steps Taken****
1. **Opened Chrome Extension Manager**  
   Accessed all installed extensions via chrome://extensions/.  

2. **Reviewed Each Extension**  
   Examined all extensions currently installed:  
   - Adobe Acrobat: PDF edit, convert, sign tools  
   - Cookie Editor  
   - Free VPN for Chrome – VPN Proxy VeePN  
   - Google Docs Offline  
   - McAfee WebAdvisor  
   - VPN Free – Betternet Unlimited VPN Proxy  
   - Wappalyzer – Technology profiler  

3. **Checked Permissions and Developer Credibility**  
   Verified each extension’s permissions and cross-checked with Chrome Web Store reviews.  

4. **Identified Suspicious or Unused Extensions**  
   - Free VPN for Chrome – VeePN and Betternet VPN: Free VPN extensions often collect user data and slow down browsers.  
   - Cookie Editor: Although useful, it grants access to cookies which could be risky if not from a trusted source.  
   - Wappalyzer: Safe but not needed for normal browsing — used mainly for web development analysis.  

5. **Removed or Disabled Unused Extensions**  
   - Disabled Betternet VPN (not in use).  
   - Removed Free VPN for Chrome – VeePN to prevent unnecessary data access.  
   - Retained only trusted extensions such as Adobe Acrobat, McAfee WebAdvisor, and Google Docs Offline.  

6. **Restarted Chrome Browser**  
   Restarted to apply changes and check performance improvements.
